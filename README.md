# Google interface cloning
Created with HTML and CSS at Tecnolochicas bootcamp ðŸ’œ

## Introduction 
HTML and CSS are the main code languages â€‹â€‹used to control the style and layout of web pages. A good HTML and CSS practice is to clone existing web pages. The following project presents the cloning of the Google search engine, as part of the work plan of the Tecnolochicas 2023 bootcamp.

## What did I build?
First I worked in HTML to add all the necessary elements, such as images, buttons, anchors, lists, divisions and sections. Then in CSS I built the header, the main part and finally the footer. I tried to match the color, size, and font of the letters; the format of the images; and the effects of hovering over an element.

## Objetive of the project
Make a clone of the Google home page using the HTML and CSS code languages.
